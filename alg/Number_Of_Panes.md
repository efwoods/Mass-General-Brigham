Assume the following:
1. Each Window contains 4 Panes
2. Each Bedroom has at least 1 Window
3. Each Home has at least 1 Bedroom
4. My Hometown has approximately 40,000 residents
5. Each resident has at least a 1 Bedroom 1 Bathroom Home
6. No Home is larger than 2 Stories tall
7. The Homes are all quadrilateral
8. No story has more than 8 windows (two per side)

   Given above, there must be at least 160,000 panes of glass in my Hometown (40,000 residents-per-Hometown x 4 Panes-per-Window x 1 Window-per-Bedroom x 1 Bedroom-per-resident). At most, there are 2,560,000 Panes of glass in my Hometown (2 Stories-per-Home x 8 Windows-per-Story x 4 Panes-per-Window x 40,000 Residents-per-Hometown x 1 Home-per-Resident). The average number of panes of glass is therefore 1,400,000 ((2,560,000 - 160,000)/2).
